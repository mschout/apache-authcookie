OVERVIEW

Apache::AuthCookie allows you to intercept a user's first unauthenticated
access to a protected document. The user will be presented with a custom
form where they can enter authentication credentials. The credentials are
posted to the server where AuthCookie verifies them and returns a session
key.

The session key is returned to the user's browser as a cookie. As a cookie,
the browser will pass the session key on every subsequent accesses.
AuthCookie will verify the session key and re-authenticate the user.

All you have to do is write a custom module that inherits from AuthCookie.
See the POD documentation for more details.

INSTALLATION

This module uses the Apache::Test framework for testing.  As a result, any
other Apache::Test parameters can be used when generating the Makefile.

    perl Makefile.PL -apxs /usr/sbin/apxs
