Revision history for Apache::AuthCookie

3.31  2022-01-05
   - Fix uninitialized variable warning if "Satisfy" was not set (github #15, thanks yewtc)

3.30  2020-04-14
   - Fix logic error for EnforceLocalDestination
   - Add a bunch of tests to cover all scenarios of EnforceLocalDestination and
     DefaultDestination

3.29  2020-03-22
   - Add optional support for enforcing a local destination, like so:

        PerlSetVar MyAuthEnforceLocalDestination 1

   - Add optional support for specifying a default destination when the login
     form's destination argument is unspecified or invalid (including
     non-local if local destinations are enforced), like this:

        PerlSetVar MyAuthDefaultDestination /protected/user/

3.28  2019-11-19
   - Add support for SameSite cookie property (can be strict/lax).
   - Minor POD updates.

3.27  2017-07-28
   - Fix POD spelling error [#118545].

3.26  2016-09-30
   - remove unused module Apache::AuthCookie::Autobox from dist
   - remove CGI.pm dependency.  CGI.pm has been removed from perl core, which
     was the primary reason we used it in the first place.  Replaced with
     dependency on lighter weight set of three modules:

        * HTTP::Body
        * WWW::Form::UrlEncoded
        * Hash::MultiValue

     Also recommended (but not required) is WWW::Form::UrlEncoded::XS
   - Add optional support for charset encoding.  If you have something like

        PerlSetVar MyAuthNameEncoding UTF-8

     Then AuthCookie with now automatically decode parameters using the given
     encoding now. AuthCookie params() data will be decoded automatically if
     this is on.  See details in AuthCookie module documentation.  In addition
     r->user will be encoded (using byte semantics) using this encoding. 

     ***** IMPORTANT *****
     If you turn this on, this could break your code.  r->user() will now be
     byte encoded using the given encoding.  If you use usernames that contain
     non-ascii characters you either need to use decoded_user(), or decode
     r->user() yourself in your subclasses.

     See the AuthCookie docs for more details.
   - add optional support for decoding httpd.conf requires directives. This is
     enabled with a RequiresEncoding setting:

        PerlSetVar MyAuthNameRequiresEncoding UTF-8

     Then decoded_requires($r) will return the decoded value of $r->requires
     You only need this if you have non-ascii characters in your requires
     directives such as:

        Requires user programmÃ¸r

   - add decoded_user($r) method to get the value of r->user decoded using
     character semantics instead of bytes.  Due to the fact that r->user is a C
     API method we cannot get character semantics on r->user directly.  If no
     Encoding directive is in effect, then this is the same as r->user.
   - add encoding($r): string which returns the value of the Encoding directive
     that is in effect for the current request.

3.25  2016-08-30
   - 2.4: fix POD typo and add missing ABSTRACT
   - reorganize real.t tests into subtests
   - make sure signature test ignores generated files
   - remove autobox dependency
   - fix authenticate so that r->user is copied from r->main on subrequests.
     Previously this was only done for internal redirects (r->prev is defined).
     This fixes DirectoryIndexes on AuthCookie enabled directories under apache
     2.4.

3.24  2016-01-13
   - Update Apache 2.4 README, flesh out guts of Authz Provider notes.
   - Improve Apache 2.4 README's AuthzProvider documentation
   - Add POD to Apache2_4::AuthCookie
   - Add FAQ to Apache2_4::AuthCookie documenation
   - 2.4: document that PerlAddAuthzProvider is only needed for *custom* Requires directives.
   - 2.4: make authz_handler recognize multiple usernames in the directive like
     mod_authz_user does.
   - add test case for internal authz_handler
   - explicitly require Apache::Test 1.39 so that APACHE2_4 defines are set

3.23  2015-09-10
   - Improve CGI mode param() handling to avoi CGI.pm's "param() called in list context" warning.
   - add support for Apache 2.4 via mod_perl 1.09.
     ***** IMPORTANT *****
     Apache 2.4 has a *VERY* different API for authentication.  You will need
     to port your subclass and configuration over to the Apache 2.4 API in
     order to use Apache 2.4!  Please be sure to read README.apache-2.4.pod for
     porting instructions!

3.22  2014-05-07

3.21  2014-05-07
   - Bad release - deleted

3.20  2013-12-09
   - login_form: return OK for mobile IE 10, which also ignores content for
     FORBIDDEN response.
   - test .pl registry scripts: do not try to load mod_perl.pm
   - escape html tags in destination.
   - fix abstract in FAQ pod.

3.19  2012-12-28
   - split out CGI data handling into ::AuthCookie::Params modules
   - use Apache::Request/Apache2::Request from libapreq if available. Otherwise,
     fall back to CGI.pm for handling CGI data.
   - improve "removed cookie" debug log message
   - add dependencies: autobox, Class::Load
   - allow username to be '0'
   - login_form: return OK for SymbianOS, which ignores content for FORBIDDEN responses.
   - add login_form_status() to override HTTP status returned by login form
   - recognize_user: return DECLINED if user is not recognized

3.18  2011-01-24
   - remove 3.17's test skip hacks, and bump Apache::Test prerequisite to v1.35
     which fixes this issue.
   - fix MANIFEST.SKIP to ignore generated t/conf/mime.types
   - remove dist.ini, weaver.ini from dists
   - fixed t/real.t to use correct -withtestmore import syntax
   - rename sample authcookie handlers to Sample::Apache and Sample::Apache2
     namespaces

3.17  2011-01-19
   - skip the test suite if running as root.  Apache::Test 1.34 fails the test
     suite if running as root instead of skipping it.  By skipping, AuthCookie
     can be installed via CPAN.pm as root.

3.16  2011-01-19
   - require Apache::Test 1.32 - fixes ubuntu build issue
   - remove mod_perl/mod_perl2 related prereq's from META.yml.  The correct mod
     perl version is not known until Makefile.PL is run.  CPAN.pm should not
     try to install either one until it is known which one is appropriate.
     (RT 64926)

3.15  2010-08-27
   - enable Dist::Zilla Manifest plugin
   - add FAQ
   - add FAQ entry on how to protect an entire site/document root
   - recognize_user: return DECLINED if user is already set
   - refactor P3P header generation into send_p3p($r) so subclasses can overload it

3.14  2010-04-12
   - MP2: doc updates: remove beta warnings, change Apache::AuthCookie to
     Apache2::Authcookie where appopriate.
   - docs: change my email to my cpan address
   - docs: remove POST limitations reference (handled by POST to GET conversion)
   - sign dist with Module::Signature
   - add signature test
   - MP1: perltidy Apache::AuthCookie sources.
   - update mod_perl2 prereq version (still 2.0.0 RC5, but version number was
     incorrect in Makefile.PL)
   - use Dist::Zilla for building the dist

3.13  2010-04-12
   - removed: bad dist

Version: 3.12
   - Makefile.PL If no mod_perl version is found, just require mod_perl2.
     This makes sure that CPAN testers will get the right dependencies.
     way. Also set up PREREQ_PM properly for mod_perl version 1.

Version: 3.11
   - Fix tiny pod doc error.
   - Escape CR and LF in 'destination' field to prevent possible XSS attack
     [Steffen Schwigon]

Version: 3.10
   - Bug Fix: when copying user from prev request, check that $r->prev
     is defined, not just that $r->is_initial_request is true.

Version: 3.09
   - POD doc fixes.
   - MP2: remove _check_request_req() - this was only necessary when
     running under both MP1 and MP2.  Package name change eliminates the
     need for this.
   - test suite converted to Test::More style test suites.
   - descriptive test descriptions added
   - make login() stash credentials in $r->pnotes("${AuthName}Creds") so
     that the login form can access the user-supplied credentials if the
     login fails.
   - bug fix: use of Apache2::URI::unescape_url() does not handle
     '+' to ' ' conversion.  This caused problems for credentials
     that contain spaces.
   - MP2: remove mod_perl features from "use mod_perl2" line. This is 
     no longer supported by mod_perl2.
   - MP2: _get_form_data() - switch to CGI.pm to handle form data (fixes
     several form data handling bugs)
   - In a subrequest, copy $r->prev->user to $r->user (or r->connection->user 
     for MP1).
   - remove Apache2::AuthCookie::Util - no longer necessary
   - multi-valued form fields are now handled properly in POST -> GET conversion
   - MP2: require CGI.pm 3.12 or later

Version: 3.08
   - fix "authorize user" error log that was missing a debug level check
     (thanks Barry)
   - fix test cases 3, 6, 18 for Win32
   - clean up t/real.t

Version: 3.07
 *** mod_perl2 users: THIS RELEASE IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH PAST RELEASES    ***
 *** If you are running mod_perl2, you must update to at least           ***
 *** mod_perl 2.0.0 RC5.  The mod_perl2 version of AuthCookie has been   ***
 *** renamed to Apache2::AuthCookie                                      ***
  ** MP2: RENAME AuthCookie.pm.mp2 to Apache2::AuthCookie.
   - MP2: Update module, and tests for mod_perl 2.0.0 RC5.  mod_perl2 users
     MUST use Apache2::AuthCookie now.
   - Require Apache::Test 1.22
   - Add support for ${auth_name}SessionTimeout configuration paramter
     which will re-issue the ticket with the expires parameter set to the
     value of this configuration setting for each request.  This is useful for
     idle-timeout.
   - POD fixes.
   - MP2: fix uninitialized warnings if no POST/GET data (RT 11371)
   - make sure recognize_user() returns an Apache constant in all cases.
     Returns DECLINED in cases where we were returning undef before.
     (Thanks Vivek)
   - Add support for MS HttpOnly cookie property.

Version: 3.06
  ** BUG FIX: AuthNameSatisfy (Any|All) directives were broken. AuthCookie
     was using AuthCookieSatisfy rather than ${auth_name}Satisfy.  If you
     used this feature and had an "AuthCookieSatisfy" directive in your
     config file, you MUST change this to ${auth_name}Satisfy.
     E.g.: "WhateverSatisfy All"
   - created better test cases for AuthNameSatisfy directives.
   - when redirecting, set Location with headers_out() not err_headers_out().
     apache prefers Location in headers_out, even if the status code is not
     200.
   - MP2: Apache::unescape_url() -> Apache::URI::unescape_url()
   - check for mod_perl 1.9913 or later for Apache::URI (Frederick Moyer)
   - Remove set status in login.pl which caused malformed custom error
     document (Frederick Moyer)
   - Add support for ${auth_name}CookieName to change the name of the cookie
     used for each auth name.  Default remains ${auth_name}_${auth_type} if
     not set.
   - make some debug log_error() calls conditional on $debug

Version: 3.05
   - Fix POD documentation bug (thanks Steve van der Burg)
   - login(): set Location header with err_headers_out rather than headers_out
     (Casey West)
   - put cookie removal code in remove_cookie() method, put cache handling
     code in handle_cache() (Mark A. Hershberger)
   - reorganized tree to support multiple mod_perl versions.
   - rewrote tests to use Apache::Test framework from CPAN.
   - fix POD errors in authorize() documentation.
   - initial support for mod_perl version 2
   - mp2: check for Apache::RequestRec arg so that unported subclasses
     throw exceptions.

Version: 3.04
   - add _convert_to_get() to login_form(), and make POST -> GET conversion
     skip credentials and destination data so only extra data is copied. This 
     ensures that "destination" wont contain the login data.

Version: 3.03
   - various POD typos fixed (Eric Cholet)
   - Add support for ${AuthName}P3P which will set up a P3P header that will
     be sent with the cookie.
   - fix undefined warning in _convert_to_get (David K Trudgett)
   - fix potential cookie clobbering if cookie was set in earlier handler
     phase in send_cookie() (Carlyn Hicks).
   - various undefined value warnings eliminated

Version: 3.02
   - Add support for AuthNameSatisfy directive (can be Any/All, default: Any)
   - Move cookie path setting into get_cookie_path() so that users can
     overload this function if they desire (Thanks Raj Chandran)
   - POST -> GET conversion was broken (r->content called twice). Fixed.

Version: 3.01
   - adopted support for custom_errors() hook from michael@bizsystems.com.
   - Fixed incorrect documentation in authorize() (thanks to David Young).
   - login() handler changes:
       o if "destination" isnt in posted data, set AuthCookieReason to 
         no_cookie and return to login_form (previously just returned
         SERVER_ERROR).
       o if authen_cred() returns false, set AuthCookieReason to
         bad_credentials and return to the login form.
       o try to handle POST -> GET conversion.
   - CGI::Util dependency removed (these are internal subroutines for CGI.pm)
   - ${AuthName}Path will default to "/" if it is not specified (MSIE 6.0
     wont set cookies without path)
   - fix login() handler change so that destination doesnt get lost on
     subsequent login attempts (thanks Phillip Molter)

Version: 3.00
   - New maintiner: Michael Schout <mschout@gkg.net>
   - changed to hard coded $VERSION rather than RCS Revision style.
   - Revamped testing code to use Apache::test (with minor mods).
   - Added support for ${AuthName}Expires parameter that can be used
     to make your cookie persistent.
   - CGI::Util is now used for parsing the "Expires" parameter. If you are 
     missing this package, you probably need to upgrade your CGI.pm package.

Version: 2.011  Date: 2000/06/17 08:01:19
   Several people have requested a mechanism for the login script to be
   able to tell the difference between a failed login and a first attempt
   at a login.  Typically one can figure this out by whether a cookie has
   been sent or not, so I've put some information to that effect in
   $r->prev->subprocess_env().  See the login script docs for specifics.
   
   I also cleaned up the documentation for the login script.


Version: 2.010  Date: 2000/06/17 01:37:16
   (merged changes from sub-releases into main CVS branch.  Been living
   in CVS hell.  My CVS-hubris got the better of me, tried to do things
   with tags & soforth and wound up severely confused.  Thus the version
   numbers jumped a bit.)
   
   Made some minor documentation updates.


Version: 2.009  Date: 2000/06/14 15:54:00
   *** empty log message ***


Version: 2.008  Date: 2000/06/14 15:36:12
   Instead of replacing the Set-Cookie header when we set the cookie, add
   to it.  This means we won't clobber other folks' unrelated cookies
   when we set ours.  It also means you need at least mod_perl version
   1.24 (I think).  [rlocke@infiniteinfo.com (Robert Locke)]


Version: 2.007.002.001  Date: 2000/05/14 18:06:30
   Added a PerlSetVar *Cache parameter that you can set to a true value
   to allow cacheing.  Also removed cache control from regular requests -
   cacheing still happens on login & logout.  [asparks@cpd.harris.com
   (Alan Sparks) and dtaylor@vialogix.com (Drew Taylor)]
   
   Split off the login-form-displaying code into its own method, called
   login_form().  Can be overridden in subclasses.  The default method
   uses $r->custom_response() to display the login. [richter@ecos.de
   (Gerald Richter)]
   
   Added documentation for the send_cookie() method.


Version: 2.007.001.001  Date: 2000/04/29 20:03:51
   Created the send_cookie() method, which just creates the cookie and
   calls $r->err_header_out to send it to the browser.  It is
   occasionally useful to override this method if you need to change the
   value of the cookie before sending it out (for instance, to update a
   timestamp).  [mschout@gkg.net (Michael J Schout)]
   
   Changed the _cookie_string() method to cookie_string().
   
   Added a PerlSetVar configuration directive "{YourAuth}Secure" which
   will secure cookies (i.e. only send them over a secure connection).
   [mschout@gkg.net (Michael J Schout)]


Version: 2.007  Date: 2000/04/15 15:27:02
   branches:  2.7.1;  2.7.2;
   If the browser sends a cookie but it's not one related to our
   authentication, we formerly sent a blank cookie to the authentication
   methods.  Now we act as if no cookie was sent.
   [asparks@cpd.harris.com (Alan Sparks)]
   
   Fixed a server error that occurred when a certain user was required,
   but a different valid user was logged in.
   [efujii@miis.edu (Eduardo Fujii)]
   
   Added a couple more debug statements that can help figure out what's
   happening when your auth isn't working.
   
   Improved some of the docs.
   
   Added some tricks to Makefile.PL to make my life easier.
   
   Changed the action of the example login forms from LOGIN to /LOGIN.
   [michael@bizsystems.com (Michael)]


Version: 2.006  Date: 2000/03/26 18:28:32
   Added the key() method, which will return the user's current session
   key, if any.  This can be handy inside a method that implements a
   C<require> directive check (like the C<species> method discussed
   above) if you put any extra information like clearances or whatever
   into the session key.
   
   Added method-by-method documentation for each method in AuthCookie.


Version: 2.005  Date: 2000/03/24 15:20:30
   Removed the deprecated methods ->authen and ->authz.  If you have
   configurations that use these methods, you must change to the newer
   ->authenticate and ->authorize methods.
   
   Changed a couple of 'Sample's in the documentation to
   'Sample::AuthCookieHandler'.  [asparks@cpd.harris.com (Alan Sparks)]


Version: 2.004  Date: 2000/03/15 20:53:20
   Added documentation about the ability to set cookie domains.  That
   ability actually appeared in 2.002, but I forgot to document it or add
   notes to the Changes file.


Version: 2.003  Date: 2000/03/14 21:08:02
   Now returns FORBIDDEN instead of AUTH_REQUIRED when authorization
   fails or when a user tries to access a protected doc.


Version: 2.002  Date: 2000/03/14 17:46:42
   Added an internal _cookie_string method that helps construct cookie
   strings.  This shouldn't change any functionality, but makes my job
   easier.
   
   Added a couple of Makefile.PL questions that set the user & group
   tests should run under.


Version: 2.001  Date: 2000/02/11 04:46:59
   The login forms may now use the POST method instead of the GET method.
   This is a big deal, because with GET the user's credentials get logged
   to access logs, they remain in the user's browser history, and so on.
   Thanks to cholet@logilune.com (Eric Cholet) for the patch and prodding.
   
   There is now a proper test suite, which will fire up an httpd and make
   requests of it.  The test code is adapted from Eric's old example
   (eg/) suite.
   
   I've added a logout() method to help unset cookies.  The example
   logout.pl now uses logout().  Thanks to Aaron Ross
   (ross@mathforum.com).


Version: 2.000  Date: 2000/02/02 13:18:23
   First released version, bumped up revision number to 2.0
   
   Created indentify() and authorize() methods to replace authen() and
   authz().  authen() and authz() are now deprecated and will disappear
   in a later version.
   
   AuthType can now contain colons [adi@certsite.com (Adi)]
   
   Nonexistent method calls (via 'require' directive) are no longer
   shielded in authorization stage - if it fails it fails, and you get a
   server error.
   
   Multiple 'require' directives should work now - previously only the
   first directive was respected.
   
   Changed lots of documentation to reflect the above interface changes.


Version: 1.002  Date: 2000/01/27 22:07:13
     - Now owned by Ken Williams (ken@forum.swarthmore.edu)
   
     - Created indentify() and authorize() methods to replace authen()
       and authz().  authen() and authz() are now deprecated and will
       disappear in a later version.
   
     - AuthType can now contain colons [adi@certsite.com (Adi)]
   
     - Nonexistent method calls (via 'require' directive) are no longer
       shielded in authorization stage - if it fails it fails, and you
       get a server error.
   
     - Multiple 'require' directives should work now - previously only
       the first directive was respected.


Version: 1.001  Date: 2000/01/25 01:21:05
   Eric's original version from CPAN
